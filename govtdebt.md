# Visualizing Government Debt
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provies free, easy to use and downloadable datasets for public consumption (thanks!). Their website also includes a tool that allows you to design interactive visualizations and embed them directly from their website. The first graph in this series comes from the OECD design tool, while the second and third graphs were created using the same OECD dataset on the platform Flourish. 

# The OECD Bar Chart 
In the bar chart below, color is used to bring the reader's eye imediately to the position of the USA relative to the other OECD countries that reported their debt-to-GDP in the year 2018. The minimalist design lays a backdrop to accentuate the chosen bar, a great choice to compliment commentary on a specific country within the crowd.

# Visualizing with Flourish - Grid of Charts
In this chart, all 37 countries that reported their debt-to-GDP ratio in the 1995-2019 dataset are displayed using line charts in a grid format. In this view the single colored line and grey backdrop gives an overhead view of the varying trends across countries. For a closer look, the interactive graphic allows the reader to hover the mouse over any given line to activate a pop-up that displays the exact ratio value for any given year and country. A quick look gives way to some abnormailites in the time series - I wonder what happend in Ireland, Greece, and Japan to cause the abnormal dips and highs!

# Visualizing with Flourish - Single Line Chart
In this chart, you can see the debt-to-GDP ratio for the G7 countries, one by one. This is an alternative representation to the grid of charts above. In this graphic, it is easier to focus in on the trends of a specific country, rather than compare the trends across several countries at one time. Moreover, clicking through the selection pane at the top of the chart provides a dynamic view into the shift in trends across the countries. This type of visualization would be more useful for an in-depth analysis of a select group of countries from the dataset (in this case the G7 members).
