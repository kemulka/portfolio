# Final Project Part III

When I laid out my project outline in Part I, I had a very specific aim to convince my audience that student loan debt should be forgiven by the government. However, as I researched the topic more and more, I found myself wandering off into branches of the issue (racial disparities, types of loans, why the debt is increasing, who is responsible, proposed policies to address the debt, etc.). As it turns out, there is a lot more research and journalism related to student debt out there than I expected – and it is a complicated, high-profile issue.

This complication started to come into play when I began storyboarding my presentation in Part II of this assignment. I couldn’t decide what parts of the puzzle were most convincing to my narrative, and it didn’t feel cohesive to include a variety of angles on the topic. So, going into the user research phase of the project I didn’t have all of my visualizations drawn out. I looked to the interviews as an opportunity to discuss with others how I could narrow down my approach. I got a lot of good feedback during my interviews, but I still felt like I was taking on too much content. In reflecting on my Part II wrap up a few days later, I remembered how during the conversations I found myself reorienting my interviewees who don’t support student loan relief to the fact that even though they don’t have debt this is a societal issue they should care about. It dawned on me that before I could convince them that student loan forgiveness was a policy they should support, they needed to care about the topic first. Of course, it’s logical that people without student debt would not be as invested in the subject, and so I began to focus in on the reasons why they should be. 

In the last week of my project, I reworked my Shorthand outline to cater to my revised story arc and developed new graphs to accompany it. The finalized story starts out by explaining, generally, that America as a “you” has a problem because student loan debt is on the rise, using standard facts and figures. This is often how I hear student loan debt spoken about. In the next section I outline that there is typically a difference of opinion between debt holders and non-debt holders. After that, I aim to grab the attention of the non-debt holders and explain why they should also care, touching on economic, social, and societal reasons. Here is where I reiterate my opening line but change the personification of America to “we,” driving home that we need to shift the way we speak about student loan debt. The last section is a call to action, which is aimed at raising awareness about student debt and includes guidance for both debt holders and non-debt holders. Ultimately, I felt this story would reach a larger group of people and make more of an impact than trying to work through decades of research and stir up political debate. I definitely learned how the review and rework steps of this process make for a better end product.
