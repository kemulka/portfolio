# Critique by Design

"When we create a data visualization, we do so with particular objectives in mind—or at least we should. We visualize data to help people understand particular facts and what they mean. We design the visualization to feature those facts in a way that can be understood and to a degree that is useful. Any data set can be visualized in many ways, depending on the meanings contained therein that we choose to communicate. Visualizing data is an act of interpretation. What we choose to include and how we display it transforms data into a message.” – Stephen Few, Perceptual Edge

In this project, I will be critiquing a visualization I found publicly available online using the [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) method and then taking the visual through a rework process with the end result being a more effective data visualiztion. 

# The Visual 

![alt text](/BrookingsViz.JPG)

The visual chosen for this critique project appeared in ["Black-white disparity in student loan debt more than triples after graduation"](https://www.brookings.edu/research/black-white-disparity-in-student-loan-debt-more-than-triples-after-graduation/
) by Judith Scott-Clayton and Jing Li, published October 20, 2016. I landed on this graphic because I am interested in research and policy discussions related to student loan debt. I was not familiar with the data prior to reading this article, yet found the research findings presented in the report compelling. This particular data visualization, as is, seemed to distract from the message, so I was motivated to create a graphic that helped tell the compelling story.

**Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently?**

Overall, I find this visualization displays important information that is relevant to the article, but it is an ugly, overwhelming graphic. When I first saw the visualization, my eyes did not know where to go - they darted around. There is a lot of bold text and there is no hierarchy to it (title, subtitles, labels are all the same size and style). It takes a minute to understand that there are four graphs, representing unique types of data with different y-axis scales (panel B is missing a y-axis label entirely). I like the depiction of the separate graduation years in side-by-side bars but I do not think the blue and red coloring works well, since the red/blue typically is used to represent political parties. Since the x-axes data is categorical, I would put the bars in order from highest to smallest value by 2012 graduation cohort. To improve the visual appeal of the graph, I would remove the bold text and use color to highlight the major comparison points (black and white groups). I would also probably remove panel D because the data is filtered to undergraduate loans only, which makes it less cohesive with the other parts.  

**Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?**

The primary audience for this visualization is anyone interested in research on student loan debt and related policy implications (academics, think tanks, policy makers, and the general public). I do not feel the visual is effective in reaching a reader that is skimming through the article like a Hill staffer or member of the press, but it is more so accessible to an individual researcher who has the time to read the details of the article and absorb all the complexities of the graph. If the visualization was made more engaging and simple, it could reach a broader audience.  

**Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?**

The data visualization effectiveness profile required me to look at aspects of the visualization that I would not have evaluated on my own, specifically the usefulness and completeness measures. For that reason, I found the method useful in aiding a comprehensive critique. However, I enjoyed the Good Charts model of conducting a preliminary review, then requiring a “search for more.” Additionally, I felt some of the measures combined quite a few characteristics. I would recommend splitting completeness into two measures, one measuring for relevance of information provided and one measuring intended level of understanding. 


# The Rework and Wireframe

My main objective in the rework for this graphic was to simply the message. In the article, the graphic is used to accompany the following statement, "Finding #1: Racial disparitites in student debt are larger than previously understood, and have grown dramatically in recent decades." The author goes on to cite a large gap between black and white students in how much they owe four years after graduation, using figures from 1993 and 2008 graduates. I focused in on the references to disparities being "large" and having "grown dramatically." It is this message I aim to tease out of the messsiness of the original graphic to create a more compelling picture of the author's important finding.

Keeping in mind my objective, along with the points from my critique, I sketched out a few bar charts and a table that focused in on the borrowing gap growth over time.

Reviewer #1: Black graduates owe $50k in debt on average? In 1993 debt burden was fairly consistent across racial groups, but black graduates have more now than the rest. The table is a little confusing - black graduate's owed that much more? The axis labels could be more descriptive.

Reviewer #2: Woah, I see that black borrowers have a lot more debt. It took me a minute to see the bar charts show a comparison for two different years. The bar charts are easy to read, but it took me a second to realize the scales are different, percentages and currency. 


# The Redesign 

The first rework design is a grouped bar chart. This is the same chart type as the original, but using one chart helps focus the audience's attention on the set of figures that is most compelling, in my opinion. Take a look -

Instead of darting around, the eyes are drawn to the large difference in average total debt owed four years after graduation for black graduates in 2008 compared to the rest of the racial groups. To do this, I used color on the set of bars of most interest, and ordered the bars from highest to lowest total debt. The secondary point is that historically, the average total debt owed was pretty consistent across racial groups, but that has changed in recent years. By continuing to include the 1993 data, using a netral grey color, the reader can see quickly the bars are all about the same point. The exact figures for each bar are not important, and they are intentionally left off the chart. However, a reader can use the minimal x-axis labels to quickly see there is a larger than $20k difference between the black graduates' average and that of the second highest, hispanic graduates. 

After rereading the article, I was reminded that the authors make a very clear point in their writing - the **difference** in debt has grown between what black graduates owe and what white graduates owe **over time**. The original charts lose this message within the overwhelming amount of information provided, which requires quite a bit of mental effort to understand. The debt figures themselves are listed within sentences in the report, but it is difficult to remember each one as you read and then try to compare in your head. I thought putting the few figures into a simple table would be an effective way for the audience to make sense of the difference quickly. This approach tested well with my reviewers, so with their feedback and my own critique, I designed this table -

Ultimately, I think either of these graphs would supplement the report's finding well and could even work together as complimentary visuals. If I were to conduct another rework, I may consider using percentage of total debt in the table instead of raw dollar value or including another year of data to further explore the trend over time.
