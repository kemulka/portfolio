Outline:

Summary: A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.

Initial Sketches: anticipated data vizualizations and major elements (key headers)

Data: primary data source, description, links

Method and medium: In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  (Shorthand?)
