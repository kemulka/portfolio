# Project Outline:
The topic of student loan debt has cropped up in the news (and in my personal life!) more and more over the past few years. In 2020, student loan debt became a hot topic in the presidential primary, as Democratic candidates clashed on their approaches to the situation. This started a greater debate about "student loan forgiveness." Recent public polling shows that people with student debt support debt forgivineess policies much more than those without debt. With my project, I aim to convince those without student debt just what those with it already know -  the extent, and weight, of the student loan crisis can no longer be ignored. It's time to forgive studen loans. 

Part 1: The debt is here
- Setup why I'm interested in student loan debt
- What is student loan debt, how much of it is there, and who has the most of it 

Part 2: Why it is important to address the debt / Examples
- Part of the problem is how much of the struggles around student debt remains invisible 
- How long it really takes to pay back debt (Example: how $10,000 in debt grows over 10 years)
- Gov't programs cost taxpayers in the long run
- What could be bought instead (impact on the economy)

Part 3: How to help
- Be an informed citizen - understand how this issue affects the greater good 
- Educate your friends about student debt
- Call to action - support student loan relief policy - call your reps

# Initial Sketches

I expect to have 3-4 data-driven visualizations and at least one graphic that utilizes symbology to create a key visual the audience will remember, my initial sketches are as follows:




# Data

Publicly held (i.e. the U.S. Department of Education is the lender) student loan debt makes up 90% of all student loans, and given the story arc I have planned around federal policy, I will be focusing on just public debt for this project. The Department of Education makes data on its student loan program regularly available online, which will be my primary source: (https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio)
Notes:
- Federal Student Aid Portfolio Summary - lists total debt from 2007 through 2020 for time series dot plot (Tableau)   
- Federal Student Loan Portfolio by Borrower Location and Debt Size - for ArcGIS (or Tableau) map, will need to geocode
- Other data sets from this site for demographics if decide they would be helpful (loan type, status, age of borrowers) 

Another source, EducationData.org, compiles student loan debt statistics and provides links to additional data sets from the government that will be useful for my project:

I'll also reference some recent public polling on debt forgiveness:

# Method and Medium

For the project presentation I plan to present a story using Shorthand. The story will be built through three main parts: an introduction section, an examples and analysis section, and finally, a call to action section. The first two sections will identfiy and provide context for the problem (the massive accumulation of student loan debt) and inform the audience by shining light on some simple but shocking statistics and data-driven examples illustrated with persuasive data visualizations (primarily created in Tableau). 
I expect to have 3-4 data-driven visualizations and at least one graphic that utilizes symbology to create a key visual the audience will remember (related to the expenses of one $10,000 loan over the period of 10 years). By the end of the presentation, my aim is that the audience will be compelled to (i) share the information they have learned with others that may also not understand the student loan debt crisis and (ii) actively support legislation that forgiveness student loan debt.
