# Final Project Part II 

# Storyboard

For the project presentation I plan to present a story using Shorthand. In that vein, I draffted my storyboard as a Shorthand Story. In fleshing out the story arc, I planned to start with a dark section, highlighting the problem of student debt and then flow into subsequent sections addressing two important questions I envision the audience asking, "Why has student debt increased so much?" and "Why does it matter?". These sections are followed by a longer section that provides an example of how loans impact household spending and have larger effects on the economy. The closing section highlights that current policies are not working to address the issue and the story ends with a call to action.

Prior to creating my storyboard in Shorthand I searched for free photos using key words such as "graduation," "loan," and "student." Because student loans have a human root, I wanted to include pictures to humanize the subject throughout my presentation. For the color palette, I landed on blue and green to reference education and money. I chose a contrasting red color to invoke an alarming reaction when highlighting debt figures to build the story that the debt is a problem. This exploration resulted in the following moodboard for my project:

# User Research and Interviews

Ahead of my interviews, I developed the following User Research Protocol -

Target audience for my story: individuals that do not know much about student debt, and either don't have debt or do hold some debt but don't understand that it is a pressing issue.

Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview: I identified two friends who are opposed to student debt forgiveness to provide feedback on the level of persuasion in my graphs and challenge/provide alternative perspectives to the points I make along the story arc (representative of my target audience). The third person I sought out was someone who I knew was familiar with student debt relief advocacy. I wanted them to critique my persuasion effort and graphs from the story teller's perspective. 

Interview script: 

Intro: Thanks for agreeing to provide feedback on my project. Please take a few minutes to look at this storyboard on Shorthand. When you're done, please take a look at the data visualizations in my wireframe. 

Test & Get Feedback:
When you were looking at the storyboard, what elements resonated with you? What do you remember the most? 
Do you think the flow of the sections in the storyboard is smooth? Is there an area that you would like to see fleshed out more?  
Did any further questions come up while you were reviewing the story? 
When reviewing the wireframe, was there anything about the visualizations that you found confusing? 
Did anything surprise you?
Are there any additional visualizations that you think would help support the story's message? If yes, what type? What would you like to see? 

End: Thanks for your input!


**Interview Key Takeaways**

Interview 1 [alias Kevin]: Kevin noted that the sections in the storyboard felt slightly disjointed. He was most interested in seeing how the 'impact on the economy' section would flesh out. Kevin already was familiar with the stats about student debt presented at the beginning, so that part was less “shocking” to him than what he thought I intended.  Kevin suggested trying to overlay the increase in total debt over time with college worker’s wages over time to really highlight that wages have not increased at the same rate as the debt. Kevin mentioned that he would be interested in learning more about student debt and would definitely click on links to articles/reports at the end of my presentation (thought it was a good idea to include links for learning more about how to manage debt as well). 

Interview 2 [alias Beth]: Beth noted that she liked the pictures and the aesthetic of the storyboard a lot. She thought the pictures were very visually appealing, but worried it may be too busy for the eyes with the graphs added in. I let her know I planned to replace some of the pictures with the graphs themselves, so they are floating next to the text. She said she knew the total figure for student debt was high, but it stuck with her that the debt had increased so much recently and she hadn’t previously considered why. She commented that the proportion of mortgage debt sticks out as being considerably larger in the area chart and suggested removing it to show “non-housing” debt only. Beth suggested I include some visuals with the “why has it increased” section, specifically to showcase undergraduate vs. graduate borrowing trends if possible (to reinforce that graduate loans have increased sharply). 

Interview 3 [alias Claire]: Claire felt the storyboard sections were all good elements to back-up my storyline but cover a lot of material. It may be better to cut back on a few stronger points that don’t need much additional explaining. Claire has never had debt and feels like the total debt figures are “massive” and “obscure” numbers that don’t really have much meaning to her. She said she liked the idea of displaying types of goods that could be bought with the amount of money an average loan borrower spends on loan repayment per month or year and felt that could help her understand what the money would be going toward if some type of loan forgiveness was granted. 



# Reflection

The feedback exercise drew my attention to a few important points that I'm excited to improve upon prior to my final presentation. Mainly, I need to rework my storyboard so that it flows in a more natural order - I think I can do this by adding some additional transition text. I also will work to reduce the complexity of the content as much as possible (remove parts where I need to do a lot of explaining of the concepts) and build out my final data visualizations to tell the story of the impact that student loan repayment has on a household's ability to contribute to the economy (and the magnitude of that multiplied by the # of student loan holders in the country).
