# Final Project Part II 

# Storyboard

For the project presentation I plan to present a story using Shorthand. In that vein, I draffted my storyboard as a Shorthand Story. In fleshing out the story arc, I planned to start with a dark section, highlighting the problem of student debt and then flow into subsequent sections addressing two important questions I envision the audience asking, "Why has student debt increased so much?" and "Why does it matter?". These sections are followed by a longer section that provides an example of how loans impact household spending and have larger effects on the economy. The closing section highlights that current policies are not working to address the issue and the story ends with a call to action.

Prior to creating my storyboard in Shorthand I searched for free photos using key words such as "graduation," "loan," and "student." Because student loans have a human root, I wanted to include pictures to humanize the subject throughout my presentation. For the color palette, I landed on blue and green to reference education and money. I chose a contrasting red color to invoke an alarming reaction when highlighting debt figures to build the story that the debt is a problem. This exploration resulted in the following moodboard for my project:

# User research and interviews

Ahead of my interviews, I developed the following User Research Protocol:

Target audience: indiviudals that do not know much about studnet debt/don't have debt or do hold some debt but don't understand that it is a pressing issue

Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview: I wanted to identify
