# Final Project Part II 

# Storyboard
The topic of student loan debt has cropped up in the news (and in my personal life!) more and more over the past few years. In 2020, student loan debt became a hot topic in the presidential primary, as Democratic candidates clashed on their approaches to the situation. This started a greater debate about "student loan forgiveness." Recent public polling shows that people with student debt support debt forgivineess policies much more than those without debt. With my project, I aim to convince those without student debt just what those with it already know -  the extent, and weight, of the student loan crisis can no longer be ignored. It's time to forgive student loans. 

For the project presentation I plan to present a story using Shorthand. The story will be built through three main parts: an introduction section, an examples and analysis section, and finally, a call to action section. The first two sections will identfiy and provide context for the problem (the massive accumulation of student loan debt) and inform the audience by shining light on some simple but shocking statistics and data-driven examples illustrated with persuasive data visualizations (primarily created in Tableau). 

I expect to have 3-4 data-driven visualizations and at least one graphic that utilizes symbology to create a key visual the audience will remember (related to the expenses of one $10,000 loan over the period of 10 years). By the end of the presentation, my aim is that the audience will be compelled to (i) share the information they have learned with others that may also not understand the student loan debt crisis and (ii) actively support legislation that forgiveness student loan debt.

Part 2: Why it is important to address the debt / Examples

- How long it really takes to pay back debt (Example: how $10,000 in debt grows over 10 years)
- Gov't programs cost taxpayers in the long run
- What could be bought instead (impact on the economy)





# User research and interviews

Ahead of my interviews, I developed the following User Research Protocol:

Target audience: indiviudals that do not know much about studnet debt/don't have debt or do hold some debt but don't understand that it is a pressing issue

Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview: I wanted to identify
