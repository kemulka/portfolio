This is my repository for the Spring 2021 course Telling Stories with Data at CMU. 


# About me
Hello, I'm Kelsey!
(She / Her / Hers)

I am a first year Public Policy and Management (MSPPM) student at Heinz College. I grew up in southeast Michigan and attended undergrad at Michigan State University, focusing on international relations and social policy. Afterward, I worked in Washington, DC, starting in political campaigns and then for a nonprofit in the international education space. Mostly recently, I worked for a public policy research organization that fueled my interest in developing my technical skill set as it relates to policy analysis and data-driven decision making, leading me right to Heinz. Frankly, I have heard the term "data viz" so many times the past few years, I just had to sign up for this class to see what all the fuss is about... 

Prior to COVID, my hobbies were traveling to, and exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and trying new foods. I hope to be able to get back to that soon! In the meantime I have gotten into jigsaw puzzles, audiobooks, and baking to keep me, somewhat, sane. : )    

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn in this course how and why to use a particular type of data vizualization. I'd like to understand the common "mistakes" around use of color, design choice, and layout and how to choose the best visualtization for a particular audience. I hope to further my skills in presenting data and constructing a compelling story around it, ultimately becoming a more effective communicator. Oh, and how to navigate some new tools, like GitHub!
