This is my repository for the Spring 2021 graduate course Telling Stories with Data at CMU. 


# About me
Hello, I'm Kelsey!
(She / Her / Hers)

Prior to coming to grad school, I worked for a public policy research organization that fueled my interest in developing my technical skill set as it relates to policy analysis and data-driven decision making, leading me right to Heinz. Frankly, I have heard the term "data viz" so many times the past few years, I had to sign up for this class to see what all the fuss is about... 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn in this course how and why to use a particular type of data vizualization. I'd like to understand the common "mistakes" around use of color, design choice, and layout and how to choose the best visualtization for a particular audience. I hope to further my skills in presenting data and constructing a compelling story around it, ultimately becoming a more effective communicator. Oh, and how to navigate some new tools, like GitHub!
