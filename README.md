This is my repository for the Spring 2021 course Telling Stories with Data at CMU. 


# About me
Hello, I'm Kelsey!
(She / Her / Hers)

I am a first year masters student at CMU, pursuing a Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (MSPPM) degree.



# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn in this course how and why to use a particular type of data vizualization. I'd like to understand the common pitfalls of color, design, and layout and how to choose the best visualtization for a particular audience. I hope to further my skills in presenting data and constructing a compelling story around it, ultimately becoming a more effective communicator. Oh, and how to navigate some new tools, like GitHub!


# Portfolio
Here's where all the data viz will go!!
